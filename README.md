# ML-AutismDiagnosis
Summary : Developing machine learning models to identify factors and neurological underpinnings of ASD ( Autism Spectrum Disorder )  to better improve its diagnosis. Model is train and tested on preprocessed Data of MRI Brains of ASD and Non-ASD subjects , taken from ABIDE ( Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange ) 

The model is created by employing data engineering (e.g. Feature selection : RFE  and data filtering ) and  testing various Machine Learning ( ML ) algorithms ( KNN , Logistic Regression , Support Vector Machine etc. ) + utilizing K-Fold Cross validation  + evaluating each performance to develop a model with optimum results ( highest accuracy , specificity and sensitivity ) 


current progress :
- implementing other algorithms ( SVM , Random Forest , Decision Trees , Naive Bayes  ) 
- performing k Fold cross validation 


current results : 
 - achieved high accuracy results of diagnosis across all subject catergories ( see file "Performance.txt" )
